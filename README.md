# AI-SEO Protocol — Open Standard v1.0

**AI-SEO Protocol** is the first open standard designed to make websites readable, interpretable, and immediately usable by Artificial Intelligence systems (LLMs, AI Agents, RAG Pipelines, Autonomous Crawlers).

This repository contains the **official documentation**, the **technical specification**, the **JSON schema**, real-world **examples**, the **validator**, and the **crawler** for the AI-SEO Protocol.

## 🚀 Purpose

The AI-SEO Protocol provides a unified, machine-readable way for websites to declare structured knowledge directly to AI systems.  
It enables AIs to:

- understand website content with zero ambiguity  
- retrieve updated information in real time  
- integrate structured knowledge into responses  
- use websites as authoritative sources  

AI-SEO plays the same role for AI as **schema.org** played for search engines.
